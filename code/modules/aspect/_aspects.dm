##################ASPECTS!############
##Aspects are one time events that only fire at the very beginning of the round.
##The idea behind them is that they change something about the game world, an aspect if you will,
##to keep rounds from being samey. They can either affect a certain job, the crew on whole, or the map.
##Obviously some are going to be more balanced than others. Aspects should change something about the
##game world to make it more interesting, not annoying. Remember that when adding a new one.
##
##In order to add your own just define a new aspect datum and add it to the "possible_aspects" list.
##I'm sure there's a better way to do this, and I'll change this comment block when I find one. - Matt

IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YES, ASPECTS HAVE THE HUGE POTENTIAL TO RUIN GAME BALANCE!
								USE THIS POWER WITH CAUTION!
